# djangopolls

This is a project intended to 1, explore what I could do with the Django framework, and 2, explore content targeted advertising. 

I used Djangoâ€™s template tags to load ad components onto any page of the site. The banner ads can be uploaded through the admin site with an image, an external url, a name, and some meta tags. Ad can be loaded onto any page using the template tag.

The meta tags are meant to match the site content with the ads based on the number of matches, since site content will also be tagged. I took the time to implement a tagging system that can allow visitors to filter by tags, since that is also a big part of online media. User interactions like impressions and clicks are recorded.
